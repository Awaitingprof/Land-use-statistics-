# Land-use-statistics by country
This project aims to provide comprehensive land use statistics by country, offering valuable insights into the distribution and utilization of land across the globe. The dataset includes various indicators related to cultivated land, arable land, permanent crops, other land, and total area, enabling users to explore and analyze land use patterns and trends over time.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project  was source from Kaggle, and it contains the following columns:
1.	Country: The name of the country.
2.	Cultivated land (in km²): The total area of land used for cultivation.
3.	Cultivated land (% of total area): The percentage of the total area occupied by cultivated land.
4.	Arable land (in km²): The total area of land used for arable farming.
5.	Arable land (% of total area): The percentage of the total area occupied by arable land.
6.	Permanent crops (in km²): The total area of land used for permanent crops.
7.	Permanent crops (% of total area): The percentage of the total area occupied by permanent crops.
8.	Other land (in km²): The total area of land classified as "other," including meadows, pastures, forests, built-on areas, etc.
9.	Other land (% of total area): The percentage of the total area occupied by other land.
10.	Total area (in km²): The overall land area of the country.
11.	Year: The year of the recorded data.
Countries are ranked based on their total cultivated land area, which is calculated as the sum of the total arable land area and the total area of permanent crops.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to shed light on the global distribution of land use and highlight the significance of different land categories within each country. By analyzing the provided statistics, researchers, policymakers, and enthusiasts can gain valuable insights into agricultural practices, resource management, and environmental sustainability across nations. Additionally, this information can be utilized for comparative studies, identifying potential trends, and exploring the relationship between land use and various socio-economic factors.

## Visualization
I visualized this analysis with Power BI. 
Here's a step-by-step guide on how I utilized Power BI to visualize the land use statistics:
### Data Import: I imported the dataset into Power BI, ensuring that the columns were correctly recognized and assigned appropriate data types.
### Data Cleaning: I performed necessary data cleaning operations, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency in data formats. This step ensures that the data is ready for analysis and visualization.
### Data Modeling: I created relationships between different tables within the dataset, enabling me to combine and analyze data from multiple sources. For example, I established relationships between the country names and their corresponding land use statistics.
### Visualization Design: I designed a variety of visualizations to explore different aspects of the land use statistics. These visualizations included:
#### Bar Charts: I created bar charts to compare the cultivated land area, arable land area, permanent crops area, and other land area across different countries. This allowed me to identify the countries with the highest and lowest values in each category.
#### Pie Charts: I used pie charts to represent the distribution of land use categories within individual countries. By visualizing the percentage of arable land, permanent crops, and other land, I could assess the composition of land use in each country.
#### Heatmaps: I employed heatmaps to visualize the temporal patterns of land use statistics. By mapping the changes in cultivated land area, arable land area, permanent crops area, and other land area over time, I could identify trends and fluctuations in land use practices.
#### Interactive Maps: Power BI allows the integration of interactive maps, where I could overlay land use statistics onto a geographical map. This visualization technique provided a spatial perspective, allowing me to identify regional disparities in land use and explore correlations with geographical features.
### Dashboard Creation: I organized the visualizations into a comprehensive dashboard, enabling users to navigate through the different insights easily. The dashboard acted as a central hub, providing an overview of land use statistics and allowing for deeper exploration through interactive filters and slicers.
By utilizing Power BI or any other visualization tool, you can create engaging and informative visualizations that enhance your understanding of land use statistics. Remember, the choice of visualization tool depends on your preference, familiarity, and the specific insights you aim to derive from the data.
